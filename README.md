# Shape Tracing with Robotic Arm

## Description



In this project, we created a serial manipulator with 3 degrees of freedom that can draw shapes. The Arduino Mega is used to control the robotic arm, and Python is used to implement it.

The main methods used during implementation of this project are-

- Forward Kinematics
- Inverse Kinematics
- Trajectory generation


##  Forward kinematics
In this section, we converted the joint angles (theta1, theta2, and theta3) to the end effector coordinate. For that, we took the following actions:

- Found the Denavitâ€“Hartenberg parameters of 3 Dof manipulators.
- Using sympy (Symbolic python) created generalised homogeneous matrix and then substituited DH parameters to obtain the transform from frame three to frame zero.
- Obtained the equations of x and y in terms of joint angles and other parameters which will be further used for inverse kinematics.

## Inverse Kinematics

We determined the joint angles necessary to move the end effector to a specific coordinate using inverse kinematics. To do that, we approximated using the Newton-Ralphson method.

- Used the two equations obtained from Forward kinmatics and third equation regarding the orientation of the end effector.
- Initial guesses were made for theta1, theta2, and theta3.
- Using a first-guess calculation and the Newton-Raphson equation, the function value matrix and Jacobian matrix were obtained and hence obtaining joint angle values for a   specific coordinate.

## Trajectory Generation

Now, a trajectory must be created in order to trace shapes.

- Taking a simple line trajectory into consideration, we divided the line into a significant number of points, say 100.
- By doing this we obtained a straight line between 2 consecutive point instead of a arc.

The trajectory for various shapes, such as square, rectangle, and elipse, can be calculated using the same methodology as the line.

# Shape Tracing with Robotic Arm
This project was part of Summer Intern Program at IvLabs, the AI and Robotics lab of VNIT.


In this project we have made a 3 link robotic arm which can draw shapes.We have used the concept of forward and inverse kinematics. 


# Forward kinematics
Method of transformation of joint angles to the coordinate of the end effector.
Used the concept of DH parameter to find
